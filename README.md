Node Monkey
===========

A Node.js module for inspecting and debugging Node applications through a web browser  
  
node-monkey runs a simple server and uses [Socket.IO](https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io) to create a websocket connection between the browser and server.
It captures anything that would normally be logged to the terminal, converts it to JSON and passes it to the browser
where it can be logged in the console for inspection.

The motivation for this project came from trying to debug a Node server I wrote that used websockets.
I found it problematic trying to inspect objects with the terminal.
I tried using the built-in debugging that works with the [Chrome Developer Tools plugin](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/using-eclipse-as-node-applications-debugger) for Eclipse.
Unfortunately, I ran into a problem where setting breakpoints to inspect objects would cause the server to stop responding to heartbeats and cause the client to disconnect.
This would entirely mess up my debugging efforts. All I really needed to do was have a good way to inspect objects.
I searched Google and found projects like [node-inspector](https://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector), which doesn't work with the latest versions of Node, and [node-codein](http://thomashunter.name/blog/nodejs-console-object-debug-inspector/) which has many bugs.
And neither works with Firefox. And node-monkey was born!

Installation
------------

```
npm install node-monkey
```

Usage
-----

Using node-monkey is extremely easy.
All you have to do is include the following line in your Node.js application.
Anything that is logged to the console after this will show up in the browser console once connected.
It captures all output to `console.log()`, `console.warn()` and `console.error()`.

```javascript
require('node-monkey').start([options]);
```

To connect your browser simply go to `http://0.0.0.0:50500` in your web browser.
If you change the default `host` and `port` bindings be sure to adjust your URL accordingly.

As an alternative to viewing output through this page, you can also view output in the console of your own web application by including the following lines:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://0.0.0.0:50500/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://0.0.0.0:50500/client.js"></script>
```

**NOTE**: You do NOT have to refresh the page when you restart your Node application to continue to receive output. It will automatically reconnect.

Options
-------

* **host**: The host network interface to bind to. Default is `0.0.0.0` which means ALL interfaces.
* **port**: The port to listen on. Default is `50500`.
* **suppressOutput**: Use this to suppress terminal output when `console.log()` is called, freeing the console from clutter and allowing you to only inspect objects through the browser. Default is `true`.
* **saveOutput**: If data is logged before you are able to connect your browser, you may still want to be able to view this data. Setting this option to `true` causes node-monkey to save the output and dump it out to the browser once you connect. Default is `true`.
* **silent**: If `true` then nothing will be logged to the console when started. Default is `false`.

Examples
--------

**Example 1**
```javascript
require('node-monkey').start();
console.log('It works!', {key1: 'test', key2: ['an', 'array']});
```

**Example 2**
```javascript
require('node-monkey').start({
  suppressOutput: false
});

console.log('It works!');
console.warn('You might have done something wrong');
console.error('FATAL ERROR', {message: 'Something broke'});
```
