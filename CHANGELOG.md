## Version 1.1.3

- Update ALL package-lock dependencies to resolve Github dependabot alert

Version 1.1.1

---

- Update dependencies to fix latest security vulnerability warnings in deps
- Update docs to use modern best practices with `import` and `const`
- Fix bug ensuring only one command manager instance is used and instead runs commands with separate command interfaces

## Version 1.0.0.beta.3

- Improve documentation
- Fix bug with attachConsole() causing improper behavior and extraneous output

## Version 1.0.0.beta.2

## Version 0.2.7

- New `overrideConsole` option to disable overriding the console functions when starting NodeMonkey

## Version 0.2.5

- Changed the way commands work for added security and to make the command interface available the application developer for any desired use
- Added support for logging cyclical objects using cycle.js from <https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js> (Thanks Douglas Crockford)
- Cleaned up code a bit including moving all code related files (except index.js) to `src/` directory and breaking client HTML file into
  a separate Underscore template file
- Renamed global object from 'nm' to 'nomo'
- Added 'revertConsole()' method
- Removed `active` config option for profiler and any documentation referencing configuring the profiler until there is something to configure
